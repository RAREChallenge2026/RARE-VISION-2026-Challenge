# RARE-VISION-2026-Challenge

A growing burden of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases has increased reliance on Video Capsule
Endoscopy (VCE) for non-invasive visualization of the GI tract, thereby overcoming limitations of
conventional endoscopic methods in evaluating GI tract pathology. The sheer volume of video data,
coupled with the rarity of clinically relevant anomalies, introduced machine learning into this field to
assist in efficient and accurate analysis by addressing challenges such as class imbalance and
reducing the time required for manual review of these video data. The aim of the RARE-VISION 2026
Challenge is to promote the development of machine learning models that effectively address class
imbalance through innovative techniques, ensuring robust classification of anatomical regions and rare
pathological findings in VCE video data. This challenge leverages the Galar dataset—a large,
imbalanced, multi-label VCE dataset—to evaluate algorithm performance in real-world conditions and
encourage the development of innovative techniques for handling class imbalance. Participants will be
tasked with detecting both common and rare events across noisy, temporally continuous VCE video
streams. Automated classification pipelines will
be ranked based on innovative class-balance strategies and event-level performance metrics to ensure
fairness, generalizability, and clinical relevance.
